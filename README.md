# FrameWork
## Here is the tips for beautiful users.
## Data
  - it will contain all the dataset generator we need
  - For now, here's only the dataset generator for CITYSCAPES
  - Need dataset.DataLoader to convert it into dataloader

## Model
  - it will contain all the models we need
  - For now, here's only enet.py, which is the pyfile for ENet

## main.py
  - Here, instead using argparse
  - I use two (or more) argument dictionaies for argument passing.
